#project.mini-cv-project-with-bootstrap4

Welcome!

You can find the link to the website [here](https://robinwesterback.github.io/mini-cv-project-with-bootstrap4/)

The website is made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

To create the website I followed instructions given in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course. I changed the information to fit my own personal profile.

Thank you for reading!
